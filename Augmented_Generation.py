Your task is to summarize the "Current Chat History Summary" with the "New Interaction" between a User and an AI into a concise, information-dense technical brief (If the New Interaction contradicts or updates the Current Summary, prioritize the New Interaction).
            ### Objectives:
            1. Preserve Entities: Keep all specific names, tools, libraries, and technical constants.
            2. Maintain State: Clearly identify what has been resolved and what remains an open question.
            3. Eliminate Fluff: Remove greetings, apologies, and conversational fillers.
            4. Temporal Logic: If preferences changed during the chat, only record the most recent decision.
